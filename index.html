          <h2>Tesla car sales in Norway 2009-2022</h2>
          Published by Mathilde Carlier , Sep 15, 2023 Tesla's sales volume grew
          substantially in Norway in the past years. Norway's switch to electric
          mobility and its high purchasing power made it an ideal market for
          Tesla to infiltrate. Thus, Tesla now ranks as the best-selling car
          brand in the Scandinavian country. How many cars are sold in Norway?
          According to the most recent data, the number of passenger cars sold
          in Norway dipped by around 1.1 percent year-over-year, amounting to
          roughly 174,300 in 2022. Purely electrically powered vehicles account
          for a large portion of vehicle sales in Norway. Why are electric cars
          increasingly popular in Norway? Government incentives like tax
          reductions and subsidies, as well as lower fees for using the road are
          the reasons for why the electric car market in the country is recently
          growing so fast. Among the European countries, Norway has the highest
          rate of newly registered electric cars.
